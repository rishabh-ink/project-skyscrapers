-------------------

A tweetdeck.com like client for Stack Exchange sites. Let's you view questions within a Stack Exchange site based on the tags you give.

Built with: RequireJS, Twitter Bootstrap, KnockoutJS and supporting web technologies.

NOTE: Currently works only in Google Chrome. There're a lot of things that are not yet implemented due to lack of time. I'll continue to work on this hack and make it a full-featured client. I haven't used any Yahoo! technologies, but planning to use YQL in the future.
